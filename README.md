# Vignette Portfolio

#### Personal project created in React

#### Ralph Perdomo. February 15, 2019

## Description

Vignette is a riff on a blogâ€”a sort of mashup between a blog post and a snapchat. The purpose of a vignette is to create a piece of written content that exists on screen for a brief moment. In order to read a vignette, a user must interact with the computer or mobile device. This is done by scrolling/swiping up or down. A message will be revealed and slowly disapear.
